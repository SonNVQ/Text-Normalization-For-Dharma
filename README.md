# Text-Normalization-For-Dharma
This is a Word Macro that normalizes the text for Buddhist texts using old words and old formats.

# What does this macro do?
1. Fixing old words in Drahma texts for easier understanding. For instance, some words like 'bịnh', 'chưn', 'hột', 'nhứt', 'nhơn',... are old words, we does not use these words anymore for now. So, this macro will auto replacing these words to new words such as 'bệnh', 'chân', 'hạt', 'nhất', 'nhân',... 
2. Fixing old formats like <space>:<space> to :<space> or <space>,<space> to ,<space> or <space>?<space> to ?<space> and more. 
3. Setting up the default font size to Times New Roman 14, default margin to 2 2.5 1.5 2 cm; adding the page numbers.
